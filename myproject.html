<h1 style="color:Violet;">My Project</h1>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;"> Overview </h2>
<p>This project refers to a software system that needs to be developed and combined with modern day cctv cameras in order to optimize parking within the city and incline more drivers to feel better about spending money on parking. A software that can be integrated with cameras to tracks the cars numberplate and how long its been in a parking spot for, charging based on a number of exacT TIME SPENT rather than the typical whole hours, extended into also tracking what parking spots at what levels are empty or full saving countless people both time and money, further inclining them to drive and park in congested areas which typically require money for parking such as the CBD. </p>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;"> My motivation for this project </h2>
<p>The motivation for this project was that it is such a simple yet useful idea that not only inclines people to use their vehicles without having to worry about finding parking, or paying by the hour but more importantly helps stimulate economies by generating potentially millions of more dollars for busineses that own or want to create paid parking lots within business districts across the globe. Take one of the most busy cities on earth Manhattan “Around half of them pay to park, mostly off-street but some on-street. Taking 50 percent of the above, we have roughly 20,000 fewer vehicles coming into the CBD and paying to park.” This shows that 20000 more people more vehicles are refusin to drive into the cbd due to costly paying by the hour or day, therefore further showing the benefit that the software can provide. </p>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;"> Project Description </h2>
<p> yet to be completed </p>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;"> What software, hardware and other equipment will be needed </h2>
<p>needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.
The first hardware required are cctv cameras, and secondly parking computers/machines  to be installed in the entrances and exits of the parking lot. Pre existing software such as number plate recognition NPRs which are installed within cameras exist therefore its preexisting code whichever language written in can be used and updated so that the camera now not only tracks the number plate as letters, but parking spots (to see if theyre open not open) and the car as a whole once it enters a parking spot, coding a software that will time how long the car  stays there for.</p>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;"> Skills required for the project</h2>
<p> The main skill/requirement for the project will be having extensive knowledge on software development including but not limited to, proficient use of coding languages such as python, database knowledge, data structure and algorithims, source control, testing procedures and software frameworks. The only hardware required to produce the output are cctv cameras, and parking computers/machines which can be updated to produce the output such as parking tickets that this project requires. This should be doable as many of these skills are in demand therefore finding it easy to bring together a team of software engineers/developers in order to begin updating and editing the existing code on systems such as NPRS along with many computers/machines already exisitnig for parking places which can also be updated and edited to reach the outcome of this project. </p>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;"> Project outcome</h2>
<p> If the project is successful it will firstly incline more drivers to use their cars within busy districts without firstly worrying about having to drive around and look for parking and secondly without having to pay lump fees by the hour or day. In addition to this because more people are now inclined to use parking spaces, it will ultimately generate more income for the businesses that own it, and solve the original problem of congestion in busy areas and within car parks caused by people driving around looking for cheaper parking lots, free parking areas or empty parking spots within car parks they have already or not paid for. This development will have a positive impact on both drivers and businesses, saving money for drivers on fuel, using paid car parks, decongesting busy areas as it is now easier to find parking and more tempting to pay for parking, thus also generativing money for the businesses who own the car parks. </p>
