<h1 style="color:Violet;">ASFANDYAR KHANS PROFILE</h1>


<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">About me!</h2>
<p>For those who don’t know me my name is Asfandyar Khan, well just call me Asfi for now, and I have been assigned the wonderful student ID of s3958523. I’d describe my self to you but please bear with me, as the person I am largely fluctuates depending on the weather, the day of the week and what I ate for breakfast. Monday’s I wake up feeling like creating a billion dollar company and on Fridays I become an aspiring present day Ronnie Coleman. Now onto my nationality which is as confusing as me, I’m Pashtun which isn’t exactly a nationality but refers to my ethnicity as Afghan, however due to the wonderful state of that country right now my entire family for the last 45 years have been residing in Pakistan, meaning I speak Pashto, urdu and English, talk about a bilingual king am I right? Something everybody knows about me is I love travelling, name a country and I want to go there, with my upcoming destinations being Istanbul, dubai and Geneva. </p>

<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">My Interest in IT</h2>
<p>If you can’t see it by now I am a very confusing person meaning, my interests whilst growing up largely varied. From wanting to be a firefighter, police officer to going to the army, that is until I was old enough to understand the importance of money and see the salaries of said jobs. But hey, money isn’t everything right? This clicks into my interest in IT, because I was confused on what I wanted to do I had to look for something that would give me multiple options, where there were multiple fields I could explore to see what I like and that is where IT came into play. My interest started as soon as I realised the whole world was shifting towards technology (realised that last year) in order to improve life and make it easier, meaning that the opportunities in IT were only growing and some like me needs to fill that position. What sparked my interest in IT was my-self because once I knew when I find what I like within IT, there are no limits to it, there is no cap a field can reach such as cyber security. Meaning there will always be infinite ways to make your data more secure. </p>

<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">Why I chose RMIT and what I hope to learn here</h2>
<p>My first reason to come to rmit was because of its name, quite literally, the Royal Melbourne Institution of Technology, what do I want to pursue a career in? That’s right technology. But on a more serious note, all I’d ever hear about RMIT is about how nice and innovative the campuses are, being dead centre in the city making it easily accessible by everyone, but more importantly hearing about how they assist students in finding internships, graduate jobs and providing extensive help that may relate to any part of your university life such as your studies, or other issues. During my studies I expect to learn about the variety of fields within IT. So that I have a brief understanding of each one, what they’re like, to see if that is what I want to pursue or not. And seeing that this course would provide me with overviews of things such as coding using multiple languages, databases, cyber security it met all my needs for what I was hoping to learn about in university.

<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">My ideal job, its requirements and how I plan to work towards it!</h2>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57976045?type=standout#sol=f40a4e6134e4821aff30bab2f21693720aedd473">HelloFresh empoloyment link</a>

<p> This employment opportunity refers to a software engineering position for a company known as HelloFresh. This position means that I will be working in a team environment with 4-5 other software engineers in a hybrid schedule in order to complete various tasks required by the business. This ranges from but may not be limited to colabarating with other engineers across the company to improve their code base and systems, helping other employees through coaching and mentoring them (done through things such as code reviews) and helping develop new product features. What appeals to me the most is that this position allows me to not only work in a team but help further develop my skills through their feedback and thoughts providing me with a more stable backbone going into future jobs. Also allowing me to coach others and being a mentor means that my knowledge and skills will continue to be tested as I not only review their code but also continuously think of my own ideas in how the company can be improved through things such as their code base. To be a successful candidate for this position a minimum of 4-5 years of experience is required as a software engineer within a professional environment. Other key skills and knowledge required range from understanding how to write unit tests, knowledge of Devops and AWS services such as Terraform to being experienced in CI/CD practices and programming languages such as python. The skills I have now are very limited relating to basic understanding of python, databases, computer systems and the IT field in general, however through my bachelor degree I plan to obtain the necessary qualifications and skills needed to obtain that job and others alike, such as being proficient in python and having great understanding of AWS and the services it provides. To further build my skills I plan to code side projects using python, explore AWS courses through online platforms and gain greater understanding of fields such as artificial intelligence through using a cloud guru.

<h2 style="color:Firebrick;"> What the results of the test mean for me</h2>
<p> In all honestly the results of these tests mean little to nothing to me, because despite how complex and innovative computers and websites like these are, despite they countless things they have accomplished the one thing they can fully do is correctly judge a humans emotion or their characteristics. However taking the results into account shows that I am more towards being an open out-going person, more of an extrovert than an introvert. </p>
<h3 style="color:Firebrick;"> How may this influence my behaviour within a team and how I could take this into account whilst forming a team</h3>
<p> These results for me could honestly not work better than being in a team environment. By being outgoing and an open person I feel that it would allow me to easily connect and communicate with the rest of my team but more importantly be a leader and give feed back or criticism on how each team members can improve. However as also shown in the big five personality test negative emotions tend to get a hold of me, and within a team environment if one person such as me shows clear negativity it can rub off on the rest of the team and negatively affect performance. When forming a team the most important thing I should take into account is not that I’m an extrovert or introvert but handling my emotions correctly. As mentioned above this is what could make or break a team. Therefore I have to put my emotions behind me and step up as a leader, or a well functioning team member, ensuring that me and my co-workers are working at the best of our abilities regardless of our emotions. </p>
<h1 style="color:Violet;">My Project</h1>
<h4 style="color:Firebrick;"> An overview of my project</h4>
<p> This project refers to a software system that needs to be developed and combined with modern day cctv cameras in order to optimize parking within the city and incline more drivers to feel better about spending money on parking. A software that can be integrated with cameras to tracks the cars numberplate and how long its been in a parking spot for, charging based on a number of exacT TIME SPENT rather than the typical whole hours, extended into also tracking what parking spots at what levels are empty or full saving countless people both time and money, further inclining them to drive and park in congested areas which typically require money for parking such as the CBD. </p>
<h4 style="color:Firebrick;"> My motivation for this project</h4>
<p> The motivation for this project was that it is such a simple yet useful idea that not only inclines people to use their vehicles without having to worry about finding parking, or paying by the hour but more importantly helps stimulate economies by generating potentially millions of more dollars for busineses that own or want to create paid parking lots within business districts across the globe. Take one of the most busy cities on earth Manhattan “Around half of them pay to park, mostly off-street but some on-street. Taking 50 percent of the above, we have roughly 20,000 fewer vehicles coming into the CBD and paying to park.” This shows that 20000 more people more vehicles are refusin to drive into the cbd due to costly paying by the hour or day, therefore further showing the benefit that the software can provide. </p>
<h4 style="color:Firebrick;"> Description of my project</h4>
<p>Across the globe there are already millions of cctv cameras within use in parking lots. Whether it be paid parking lots within busy districts or non paid parking lots, Australians burn 1.3 billion dollars in fuel a year just looking for a parking spot. In addition to that there are countless people who would rather resort to using bikes, taking the train or simply walking due to the addition of having to pay for parking within certain areas. A simple way to fix and address both these problems include coding a software using any desired language (preferably python) which can then be integrated into new or current cameras used within paid or busy parking lots. Rather than the camera just acting as a surveillance device the software will program it to track a range of things such as parking spaces, cars and their number plates. By firstly tracking parking spots the software will need to be coded to see whether the parking spot is occupied (by a car, shopping cart etc) and then report back to a computer system at the entrance of the parking lots, printing a ticket of the closest available parking spot, which may be on level one parking spot 26, level 8 parking spot 32. This solves the problem of people worrying about finding parking, or if they go to a busy car park only to find out its full. In addition this part of the software can be coded for cameras within both paid and unpaid busy carparks as aiding the driver to find a parking spot can be useful regardless if its paid or non paid. In regards to paid carparks, the usual pricey per hour or per day causes a lot of drivers to refrain from going there in the first place. They may only need to park for 30 minutes, 3 hours and 20 minutes, therefore this software allows them to receive a ticket for an open car park, head to the open parking spot and once parked the camera will begin tracking how long exactly the car is parked there for. When exiting the car park they’ll arrive at the computer/machine, punch in what car park they were in and then pay for the exact time they were actually parked for. TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT (GENERATES MONEY, STOPS CONGESTION IN CAR PARKS, INCLINES MORE PEOPLE TO USE PAID AND NON PAID CAR PARKS) talk about drawbacks (PEOPLE MAY ENTER ANOTHER PERSONS PARKING NUMBER, PEOPLE MAY PARK SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT ISNT GIVEN ON THEIR PARKING TICKET.</p>
<h4 style="color:Firebrick;"> Requirements for this project (Including skills, hardware, software etc)</h4>
<p> The first hardware required are cctv cameras, and secondly parking computers/machines  to be installed in the entrances and exits of the parking lot. Pre existing software such as number plate recognition NPRs which are installed within cameras exist therefore its preexisting code whichever language written in can be used and updated so that the camera now not only tracks the number plate as letters, but parking spots (to see if theyre open not open) and the car as a whole once it enters a parking spot, coding a software that will time how long the car  stays there for. The main skill/requirement for the project will be having extensive knowledge on software development including but not limited to, proficient use of coding languages such as python, database knowledge, data structure and algorithims, source control, testing procedures and software frameworks. The only hardware required to produce the output are cctv cameras, and parking computers/machines which can be updated to produce the output such as parking tickets that this project requires. This should be doable as many of these skills are in demand therefore finding it easy to bring together a team of software engineers/developers in order to begin updating and editing the existing code on systems such as NPRS along with many computers/machines already exisitnig for parking places which can also be updated and edited to reach the outcome of this project </p>
<h4 style="color:Firebrick;"> The outcome of the project</h4>
<p> If the project is successful it will firstly incline more drivers to use their cars within busy districts without firstly worrying about having to drive around and look for parking and secondly without having to pay lump fees by the hour or day. In addition to this because more people are now inclined to use parking spaces, it will ultimately generate more income for the businesses that own it, and solve the original problem of congestion in busy areas and within car parks caused by people driving around looking for cheaper parking lots, free parking areas or empty parking spots within car parks they have already or not paid for. This development will have a positive impact on both drivers and businesses, saving money for drivers on fuel, using paid car parks, decongesting busy areas as it is now easier to find parking and more tempting to pay for parking, thus also generativing money for the businesses who own the car parks. </p>
