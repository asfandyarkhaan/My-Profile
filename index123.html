  <h2> About me </h2>
</div>

<div class="aboutmepara">
  <p>For those who don’t know me my name is Asfandyar Khan, otherwise also known as Asfi. I’d describe myself to you but please bear with me, as the person I am largely fluctuates depending on the weather, the day of the week and what I ate for breakfast. Now onto my nationality which is as confusing as me, I’m Pashtun which isn’t exactly a nationality but refers to my ethnicity as Afghan, however due to the wonderful state of that country right now my entire family for the last 45 years have been residing in Pakistan, meaning I speak Pashto, Urdu and English fluently, talk about a bilingual king am I right? More about me is that, I love travelling, with hopefully my upcoming destinations being Istanbul, Dubai and Geneva and am largely passionate with anything that has to do with consuming food! </p>

  <h2>My Interest in IT and How It Started</h2>
</div>

<div class="interestinitparagraph">
  <p>My interest in IT links back to when I was in my high-school years. Throughout all of high-school teachers and students made it seem as if you could only choose one career path and stick with it for your entire life. Doing criminology? You have to be police officer, or so I thought. This is when my interest in IT sparked, realizing that IT had a much more deeper meaning to it, that it related to several areas I could explore and choose a career in whether it would cyber security or software engineering. So as I was in my final year of VCE my interest in IT only ever grew, hearing about the world shifting towards technology, constant new developments eventually realizing everything around us had to do something in relation to technology. But more important than any of this, what motivated me and interested me in IT was myself, through acknowledging the fact that IT has no limits to it, its constantly being redeveloped, innovated, and used for new purposes, therefore if I chose a career in this the only thing that could limit me, both my abilities and capabilities is myself. There was nothing more that this field could offer that could amplify my interests any more, being one of the most diverse fields to date, being able to tailor fields within IT to whatever you see fit (eg coding and developing software for your use/purposes) I found this to be perfect for me.  </p>

  <h2> Why I Chose RMIT </h2>
</div>
<div class="whyichoserimtparagraph">
<p>I had very specific requirements on what I wanted my university to have and RMIT ticked all of them. The first being location, being located in the heart of the CBD with modern buildings and equipment it ensured that it would easily accessible for me to get to, whether it was to study, attend a lecture of get help. Secondly because I wanted to pursue a career in technology I wanted to see where RMIT stood in comparison to other universities across Australia, and coming in at 9th (via QS ranking by Subject 2022) it gave me the peace of mind that I’d be receiving one of the best educations offered by any university in the area. Finally, and most importantly is what I’ve heard through word of mouth from people that have attended RMIT, mentioning all the diverse facilities it has available for its students, the help and care it provides for its students alongside clubs to ensure students have the chance to connect and temporarily have fun and breakaway from the studying aspect of university thus making RMIT a perfect option for me.  </p>

  <h2> What I expect to learn during my studies </h2>
</div>

<div class="whatexpecttolearnparagraph">
  <p>As mentioned before I chose IT due to extensive and diverse fields it provides within the course, so during my studies I expect to gain a brief understanding of the different fields it offers such as cybersecurity, web development and software engineering. From these fields I also expect to learn more detailed aspects such as from cyber security, how is our data, passwords and information stored securely, how could it be breached and how could you recognize potential breaches. For other fields such as software engineering I expect to learn at least one main type of code such as Python so I could begin apply for internships, attend hackathons and start my own side-projects before I finish my degree.  </p>
