  <h2> About me </h2>
</div>

<div class="aboutmepara">
  <p>For those who don’t know me my name is Asfandyar Khan, otherwise also known as Asfi. I’d describe myself to you but please bear with me, as the person I am largely fluctuates depending on the weather, the day of the week and what I ate for breakfast. Now onto my nationality which is as confusing as me, I’m Pashtun which isn’t exactly a nationality but refers to my ethnicity as Afghan, however due to the wonderful state of that country right now my entire family for the last 45 years have been residing in Pakistan, meaning I speak Pashto, Urdu and English fluently, talk about a bilingual king am I right? More about me is that, I love travelling, with hopefully my upcoming destinations being Istanbul, Dubai and Geneva and am largely passionate with anything that has to do with consuming food! </p>

  <h2>My Interest in IT and How It Started</h2>
</div>

<div class="interestinitparagraph">
  <p>My interest in IT links back to when I was in my high-school years. Throughout all of high-school teachers and students made it seem as if you could only choose one career path and stick with it for your entire life. Doing criminology? You have to be police officer, or so I thought. This is when my interest in IT sparked, realizing that IT had a much more deeper meaning to it, that it related to several areas I could explore and choose a career in whether it would cyber security or software engineering. So as I was in my final year of VCE my interest in IT only ever grew, hearing about the world shifting towards technology, constant new developments eventually realizing everything around us had to do something in relation to technology. But more important than any of this, what motivated me and interested me in IT was myself, through acknowledging the fact that IT has no limits to it, its constantly being redeveloped, innovated, and used for new purposes, therefore if I chose a career in this the only thing that could limit me, both my abilities and capabilities is myself. There was nothing more that this field could offer that could amplify my interests any more, being one of the most diverse fields to date, being able to tailor fields within IT to whatever you see fit (eg coding and developing software for your use/purposes) I found this to be perfect for me.  </p>

  <h2> Why I Chose RMIT </h2>
</div>
<div class="whyichoserimtparagraph">
<p>I had very specific requirements on what I wanted my university to have and RMIT ticked all of them. The first being location, being located in the heart of the CBD with modern buildings and equipment it ensured that it would easily accessible for me to get to, whether it was to study, attend a lecture of get help. Secondly because I wanted to pursue a career in technology I wanted to see where RMIT stood in comparison to other universities across Australia, and coming in at 9th (via QS ranking by Subject 2022) it gave me the peace of mind that I’d be receiving one of the best educations offered by any university in the area. Finally, and most importantly is what I’ve heard through word of mouth from people that have attended RMIT, mentioning all the diverse facilities it has available for its students, the help and care it provides for its students alongside clubs to ensure students have the chance to connect and temporarily have fun and breakaway from the studying aspect of university thus making RMIT a perfect option for me.  </p>

  <h2> What I expect to learn during my studies </h2>
</div>

<div class="whatexpecttolearnparagraph">
  <p>As mentioned before I chose IT due to extensive and diverse fields it provides within the course, so during my studies I expect to gain a brief understanding of the different fields it offers such as cybersecurity, web development and software engineering. From these fields I also expect to learn more detailed aspects such as from cyber security, how is our data, passwords and information stored securely, how could it be breached and how could you recognize potential breaches. For other fields such as software engineering I expect to learn at least one main type of code such as Python so I could begin apply for internships, attend hackathons and start my own side-projects before I finish my degree.  </p>

  <h2> Overview of the position and what makes it appealing</h2>
</div>

<div class="overviewofpositionparagraph">
  <p> This employment opportunity refers to a software engineering position for a company known as HelloFresh. This position means that I will be working in a team environment with 4-5 other software engineers in a hybrid schedule in order to complete various tasks required by the business. This ranges from but may not be limited to collaborating with other engineers across the company to improve their code base and systems, helping other employees through coaching and mentoring them (done through things such as code reviews) and helping develop new product features. What appeals to me the most is that because this position allows me to work in a team it therefore helps further develop my skills through their feedback and thoughts providing me with a more stable backbone going into future jobs. Providing me with a hybrid schedule also makes this position more attractive because of a hybrid schedule I won’t be in the office 5 days a week reducing things such as commute times and delays meaning it helps improve my work life balance allowing me to have time to complete extracurricular activities or work on my own projects. Alongside a hybrid schedule HelloFresh also provides benefits for their employees such as 70% off their meal kits from day 1 as well as providing external courses. Furthermore, also allowing me to coach others and being a mentor means that my knowledge and skills will continue to be tested as I not only review their code but also continuously think of my own ideas in how the company can be improved through things such as their code base or new product features.</p>

  <h2>What The Test Results Mean To Me</h2>

<div class="whatthetestresultsmeantomepara">
  <p>In all honestly the results of these tests mean little to nothing to me, because despite how complex and innovative computers and websites like these are, despite they countless things they have accomplished the one thing they cannot fully do is correctly calculate a human’s emotions, traits or characteristics. However, putting that aside these results still provide me with a brief overview of who I am and what my traits are in a more general aspect. Being more on the accurate side the results provided I do agree with, as I am more on the extroverted side, being open to talking, being both an auditory and visual learner as well as having creativity as one of my strengths. </p>

  <h2>How the results may influence my behaviour within a team and how I should take it into account</h2>
</div>
<div class="howtheyinfluencemeandhowishouldtakeitintoaccountpara">
  <p>The results of each test can both negatively or positively impact my position and behaviour within a team environment/role.  Take the Myer Briggs test as an example first, because I am more of an extroverted person it ties into the other characteristics such as my strategy being social engagement. With this it means I’ll be clear and upfront with my team, engaging with them to come up with solutions or analyse problems the team is facing however in contrast to this some members of my team may not like my idea’s, and my thoughts that I communicate with them which may cause conflict within the team thus preventing problems for being solved. Or they may feel like they’re not getting a chance to talk therefore I have to take that into account and think before I take action or speak to the rest of the team, seeing what negative or positive impacts it may have an ensure the rest of the team is as involved as I am. Now taking the learning style results, because I am predominantly a visual and auditory learner, I’ll want to use PowerPoints, host team meetings, to suit my needs and how I learn but then I have to take into account that I’m in a team and everybody learns differently so the team as a collective has to come together on an agreement on the best way to carry out these tasks, if not once again it can cause conflict within the team, as people may begin to lean towards the fact that everything is being done for to suit one individual and not the rest. Finally the creativity test shows that creativity is one of my advantages, but despite how many innovative and thoughtful ideas I come up with, regardless if it benefits the team or not, there will inevitability be disagreements within the team, or people feeling as if their ideas aren’t being talked about, creating conflict once again, so within a team environment it is important that I take this into account so everyone gets their input heard and all ideas and thoughts have feedback given to them in order to avoid disagreements and future conflicts within the team. </p>

  <h1> My Project! </h1>
</div>

<div class="overviewofmyproject">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
</div>

<div class="overviewofmyprojectparagraph">
  <p>This project refers to a software, which can be integrated into cctv cameras within busy parking districts such as CBDS across the globe. As we all know, finding parking within places such as the city can be a major pain especially during busy hours, causing people to aimlessly drive around either looking for open parking spots near their destination, especially within carparks causing extra congestion and largely increasing the chances of small collisions. This software integrated into cctv, scans parking spaces (more specifically the numbers which will be painted onto the parking spaces) and if it can detect the number, it will send input back to either an app, google maps on what parking spaces are available.  </p>
</div>

<div class="motivationforproject">
  <h2> My Motivation For This Project </h2.>
</div>

<div class="motivationforprojectparagraph">
  <p>My motivation for this project largely comes from experience from myself, and many other drivers I know. Driving into the city at 6pm on a Friday night, to look for parking to arrive at a reservation at 6:30 pm, only for it to be 6:30, with parking found but a 20-minute walk away from the destination. Or alternatively driving into carpark only to be bumper to bumper with the other cars all cowering to find the near available parking spot. With parking lots being arguably the place in which most low-speed collisions occur, with 40% more crashes occurring within carparks during busy seasons such as Christmas. Worrying about parking whilst driving to busy areas shouldn’t be an issue many drivers have to face today.  <p>

<div class="descriptionofproject">
  <h2> Project Description </h2>
</div>
<div class="descriptionofprojectparagraph">
  <p> Millions of CCTV cameras exist today within parking lots, or busy areas within the city that overlook parking spaces on the side of the road or street. This needs to be taken advantage of as it makes it easier for this project as the software only relies on 2 things, cctv cameras and parking numbers. Once the software is integrated within cameras, across busy sectors of cities where parking is nearly almost always an issue, numbers also need to be painted onto the floor of the parking spaces in order to identify them such as 26A. Once the camera can detect the number on the parking space it can show the parking space as available, on an app, or integrated into a driving GPS system such as google maps. If anything covers the number, whether it’s a car, a trolly, traffic cones it’ll be unable to scan the number thus showing the parking spot as unavailable. This can come into great aid for drivers, as whilst they’re closing in on their destination they can scan for the nearest open parking spot, whether its in a parking garage, on the side of the ride, or in front of the restaurant, saving time, fuel and money as Australians themselves burn 1.3 billion dollars in fuel a year just looking for a parking spot. I believe this project is of great importance, because it purely benefits drivers, by largely helping avoid areas to become congested as people no longer are blindly looking for parking thus reducing the chance of collisions and reducing traffic. Furthermore, thinking about how hard it is already to find parking easily within the Melbourne CBD, take into account other busier areas such as the CBD in New York where ‘Demand for parking exceeds supply’, showing that this software can not only come in handy on a domestic scale, but also a global scale. However, like most projects this also has its drawbacks. As mentioned before the software works by detecting the parking numbers, and if something such as a person, news paper, cardboard box covers the number then it’ll show that the parking spot is unavailable when it isn’t. In addition to this the software system relies on an app to show drivers what spots are available and what aren’t therefore if the driver does not have apple car play, or a passenger in their seat this may incline them to use their phone whilst driving. But the largest drawback that this project may face is getting the necessary permission to integrate this software within cameras in public areas. Putting this aside by formulating and developing this project it will build my skills in regards to software development and engineering in which I hope to have a career in within the future. It’ll allow me to build my knowledge, skills, and experience and will help me allow to network with other people, thus helping build my resume and connections. In turn this project can provide me with a solid backbone for looking for my future job within the field of software development/engineering as it provides me with the necessary skills, experience and knowledge that employers may look for in a potential candidate such as myself. </p>

<div class="toolsandtechneeded">
  <h2>Relevant tools and technology needed</h2>
</div>
<div class="toolsandtechneededparagraph">
<p>The first hardware required are cctv cameras which are already widely available but is the backbone for this entire project. Secondly onto the software that needs to be developed, programming applications such as PyCharm can be used to develop the software needed for the cameras. In addition to this pre-existing software such as number plate recognition NPRs which are installed within some cameras exist therefore its pre-existing code, in whichever language its written in can be used and updated so that the camera now not only tracks the number plates but the parking numbers too. Finally, onto the app that the software will report back to and update, requires another software application to be coded on such as Quixy, AppyPie or Zoho Creator.  </p>

<div class="skillsandotherrequirements">
  <h2>Skills and other Requirements</h2>
</div>

<div class="skillsandotherrequirementsparagraph">
  <p>The main skill/requirement for the project will be having extensive knowledge on software development including but not limited to, proficient use of coding languages such as python, database knowledge, data structure and algorithms, source control, testing procedures and software frameworks. In addition to this aside from software development app development is another skill required as without the app the software will be useless as it has nothing to report to for drivers to see. In terms of hardware the only things required are cctv cameras and computers in order to being developing the apps and software that this project requires. This should be doable as many of these skills are in demand therefore finding it easy to bring together a team of software engineers/developers in order to begin updating and editing the existing code on systems such as NPRS, as well as develop an app that can be used on both android and apple for the software to report to and in terms of hardware computers are easily accessible alongside obtaining cameras.  </p>

<div class="projectoutcome">
  <h2>Project Outcome</h2>
</div>
<div class="projectoutcomeparagraph">
  <p>If the project is successful, it will become the most beneficial for drivers, as mentioned countless times it will save money, fuel and time from driving around looking for empty parking spots alongside reducing the chance of congested areas, such as parking lots and thus collisions. This solves the original problem of parking being too hard to find within busy areas such as busy districts and the problems that arise because of it such as congesting areas, increasing traffic and collisions due to people aimlessly driving around looking for a parking spot near their destination or within parking lots. This development will positively impact the driving conditions seen within busy areas across the globe, as the thought of leaving 20 minutes early to find parking is no longer something that will need to be done, providing drivers with a peace of mind knowing that the closest parking spot available will be shown to hem.  <p>
