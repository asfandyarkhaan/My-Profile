<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">About me!</h2>
<p>For those who don’t know me my name is Asfandyar Khan, well just call me Asfi for now, and I have been assigned the wonderful student ID of s3958523. I’d describe my self to you but please bear with me, as the person I am largely fluctuates depending on the weather, the day of the week and what I ate for breakfast. Monday’s I wake up feeling like creating a billion dollar company and on Fridays I become an aspiring present day Ronnie Coleman. Now onto my nationality which is as confusing as me, I’m Pashtun which isn’t exactly a nationality but refers to my ethnicity as Afghan, however due to the wonderful state of that country right now my entire family for the last 45 years have been residing in Pakistan, meaning I speak Pashto, urdu and English, talk about a bilingual king am I right? Something everybody knows about me is I love travelling, name a country and I want to go there, with my upcoming destinations being Istanbul, dubai and Geneva. </p>

<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">My Interest in IT</h2>
<p>If you can’t see it by now I am a very confusing person meaning, my interests whilst growing up largely varied. From wanting to be a firefighter, police officer to going to the army, that is until I was old enough to understand the importance of money and see the salaries of said jobs. But hey, money isn’t everything right? This clicks into my interest in IT, because I was confused on what I wanted to do I had to look for something that would give me multiple options, where there were multiple fields I could explore to see what I like and that is where IT came into play. My interest started as soon as I realised the whole world was shifting towards technology (realised that last year) in order to improve life and make it easier, meaning that the opportunities in IT were only growing and some like me needs to fill that position. What sparked my interest in IT was my-self because once I knew when I find what I like within IT, there are no limits to it, there is no cap a field can reach such as cyber security. Meaning there will always be infinite ways to make your data more secure. </p>

<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">Why I chose RMIT and what I hope to learn here</h2>
<p>My first reason to come to rmit was because of its name, quite literally, the Royal Melbourne Institution of Technology, what do I want to pursue a career in? That’s right technology. But on a more serious note, all I’d ever hear about RMIT is about how nice and innovative the campuses are, being dead centre in the city making it easily accessible by everyone, but more importantly hearing about how they assist students in finding internships, graduate jobs and providing extensive help that may relate to any part of your university life such as your studies, or other issues. During my studies I expect to learn about the variety of fields within IT. So that I have a brief understanding of each one, what they’re like, to see if that is what I want to pursue or not. And seeing that this course would provide me with overviews of things such as coding using multiple languages, databases, cyber security it met all my needs for what I was hoping to learn about in university.

<h2 style="color:Firebrick;"> What the results of the test mean for me</h2>
<p> In all honestly the results of these tests mean little to nothing to me, because despite how complex and innovative computers and websites like these are, despite they countless things they have accomplished the one thing they can fully do is correctly judge a humans emotion or their characteristics. However taking the results into account shows that I am more towards being an open out-going person, more of an extrovert than an introvert. </p>
<h3 style="color:Firebrick;"> How may this influence my behaviour within a team and how I could take this into account whilst forming a team</h3>
<p> These results for me could honestly not work better than being in a team environment. By being outgoing and an open person I feel that it would allow me to easily connect and communicate with the rest of my team but more importantly be a leader and give feed back or criticism on how each team members can improve. However as also shown in the big five personality test negative emotions tend to get a hold of me, and within a team environment if one person such as me shows clear negativity it can rub off on the rest of the team and negatively affect performance. When forming a team the most important thing I should take into account is not that I’m an extrovert or introvert but handling my emotions correctly. As mentioned above this is what could make or break a team. Therefore I have to put my emotions behind me and step up as a leader, or a well functioning team member, ensuring that me and my co-workers are working at the best of our abilities regardless of our emotions. </p>
