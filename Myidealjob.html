  <h2> Overview of the position and what makes it appealing</h2>
</div>

<div class="overviewofpositionparagraph">
  <p> This employment opportunity refers to a software engineering position for a company known as HelloFresh. This position means that I will be working in a team environment with 4-5 other software engineers in a hybrid schedule in order to complete various tasks required by the business. This ranges from but may not be limited to collaborating with other engineers across the company to improve their code base and systems, helping other employees through coaching and mentoring them (done through things such as code reviews) and helping develop new product features. What appeals to me the most is that because this position allows me to work in a team it therefore helps further develop my skills through their feedback and thoughts providing me with a more stable backbone going into future jobs. Providing me with a hybrid schedule also makes this position more attractive because of a hybrid schedule I won’t be in the office 5 days a week reducing things such as commute times and delays meaning it helps improve my work life balance allowing me to have time to complete extracurricular activities or work on my own projects. Alongside a hybrid schedule HelloFresh also provides benefits for their employees such as 70% off their meal kits from day 1 as well as providing external courses. Furthermore, also allowing me to coach others and being a mentor means that my knowledge and skills will continue to be tested as I not only review their code but also continuously think of my own ideas in how the company can be improved through things such as their code base or new product features.</p>

<div class="skillsihaveparagraph">
  <p>The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have are very limited however I plan on further developing them. This includes having a basic understanding in python and most of its concepts (iterations, loops etc,) having a basic understanding in css, basic understanding of html and how to combine html and css to create websites using tools such as git and atom, and a very brief understanding of databases and computer systems. Other than this I have little to no experience or further skills relating to the employment position and IT in general. </p>

  <h2>How I plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience needed</h2>
</div>
<div class="howiplantobuildskillsparagraph">
  <p>The first few requirements and skills for the job revolve around software engineering such as having hands on experience using programming languages such as Python. Building on the knowledge I have of python and programming now I plan to enrol in external courses that will help me further develop my skills not only to become suitable enough for this job but for me to start building my own projects. In addition to that I plan on using my membership for ACloudGuru to build my knowledge and skills regarding AWS services such as DevOps, not only that but I further plan to utilizes my membership and learn about other database technologies and how to use them (such as Postgres). But I won’t just use ACloudGuru to learn and gain knowledge, but to practically apply everything I learnt, carrying out their activities and projects they provide. But most importantly to ensure I have the correct skill set, and experience and I hope to enrol within a company as an intern carrying out software engineering tasks, to later help enrol in an actual company for a software engineering position, to create a solid backbone for my resume, and meet experience requirements that future companies might require such as HelloFresh. </p>
