<h1 style="color:Violet;">My Ideal Job</h1>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">What the employment opportunity is and what makes the position appealing</h2>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57976045?type=standout#sol=f40a4e6134e4821aff30bab2f21693720aedd473">HelloFresh empoloyment link</a>
<p> This employment opportunity refers to a software engineering position for a company known as HelloFresh. This position means that I will be working in a team environment with 4-5 other software engineers in a hybrid schedule in order to complete various tasks required by the business. This ranges from but may not be limited to colabarating with other engineers across the company to improve their code base and systems, helping other employees through coaching and mentoring them (done through things such as code reviews) and helping develop new product features. What appeals to me the most is that this position allows me to not only work in a team but help further develop my skills through their feedback and thoughts providing me with a more stable backbone going into future jobs. Also allowing me to coach others and being a mentor means that my knowledge and skills will continue to be tested as I not only review their code but also continuously think of my own ideas in how the company can be improved through things such as their code base.</p>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">Skills qualifications and experiences required for the job</h2>
<p>To be a successful candidate for this position a minimum of 4-5 years of experience is required as a software engineer within a professional environment. Other key skills and knowledge required range from understanding how to write unit tests, knowledge of Devops and AWS services such as Terraform to being experienced in CI/CD practices and programming languages such as python.</p>
<h2 style="color:Firebrick;">Skills qualifications and experiences I currently have</h2>
<p>The skills I have now are very limited relating to basic understanding of python, databases, computer systems and the IT field in general, however through my bachelor degree I plan to obtain the necessary qualifications and skills needed to obtain that job and others alike, such as being proficient in python and having great understanding of AWS and the services it provides. To further build my skills I plan to code side projects using python, explore AWS courses through online platforms and gain greater understanding of fields such as artificial intelligence through using a cloud guru.</p>
