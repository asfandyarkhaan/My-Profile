  <h2> Overview of the position and what makes it appealing</h2>
</div>

<div class="overviewofpositionparagraph">
  <p> This employment opportunity refers to a software engineering position for a company known as HelloFresh. This position means that I will be working in a team environment with 4-5 other software engineers in a hybrid schedule in order to complete various tasks required by the business. This ranges from but may not be limited to colabarating with other engineers across the company to improve their code base and systems, helping other employees through coaching and mentoring them (done through things such as code reviews) and helping develop new product features. What appeals to me the most is that this position allows me to not only work in a team but help further develop my skills through their feedback and thoughts providing me with a more stable backbone going into future jobs. Also allowing me to coach others and being a mentor means that my knowledge and skills will continue to be tested as I not only review their code but also continuously think of my own ideas in how the company can be improved through things such as their code base.</p>
